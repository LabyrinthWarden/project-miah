# Project Miah: The Quest Begins

For the last few years, I've had an idea in my head I just haven't been able to shake. I have something to share. My story is important. I need to be heard, and I need to share. It's been building inside of me, and I can no longer justify holding it back.

One of the most enduring influences in my life has been The Legend of Zelda. I've played the games since I was a child, and the idea of the Triforce has always felt so elegant and perfect, especially as a framework for life. The three golden triangles each represent a virtue: Power, Wisdom, and Courage.

For most of my life, I’ve taken pride in my intelligence, so I always identified with Zelda, the holder of the Triforce of Wisdom. And I always admired Link, the hero who was the very embodiment of Courage, perhaps because I never really thought of myself as courageous.

But Power was the weird one. In the games, it’s almost always represented by the antagonist, the evil Ganon. It was a part of the triangle I didn’t want to identify with. The realization that all three parts are not only necessary, but must be held in balance within myself, has only come to me more recently.

That is the quest of Project Miah: to find that balance.

## Power: Health & Strength
For me, now, the foundation is Power. In life, Power is health, fitness, and strength. If I'm sick, weak, or unhealthy, I'm at a disadvantage when trying to implement anything else. It is the bedrock upon which Wisdom and Courage are built. My first, immediate goal for this pillar is to eliminate energy drinks. I had stopped drinking them for a long time but recently slipped back into the habit. No more.

## Wisdom: Continuous Learning
If I'm not learning, I'm not growing. And if I'm not growing, I feel like I'm dying. This pillar is my commitment to continuous learning. It's about sharpening my mind so I can navigate the path ahead. My most immediate goal for Wisdom is to start learning Japanese again.

## Courage: Becoming My Own Boss
Courage is the hardest pillar for me. Right now, it represents the work to improve my professional life by building my own business. It is about having the courage to create the life I want, not just accept the one I'm given.

Putting this quest out into the world is intimidating. I know I will likely receive feedback that tries to bring me down. I will not be perfect, and having everyone see those failures will hurt.

But I believe courage isn't the absence of fear; it's acting in spite of it.

So, every journey begins with a single step.

Here's mine. Thank you for being here at the start.
