### Don't Go It Alone.

This project is about community as much as it is about a personal quest. Whether you have a question, want to share a part of your own journey, or just want to connect, I would be happy to hear from you.

I read every message and will do my best to respond as quickly as I can.

#### Email

This is the most direct way to get in touch.

[miah@project-miah.com](mailto:miah@project-miah.com)

#### Social Media

The quest is just beginning, and so is my activity on social media. You can follow along on these platforms as the journey unfolds.
